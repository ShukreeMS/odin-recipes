    <h3>You can find cookie butter at Trader Joe's(R). They also sell cookie cocoa butter. You can also stuff the cookies with leftover cookie butter by putting a 1/2 teaspoon on a cookie sheet, freezing it for a half-hour, and then rolling the cookie dough around it!</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. Mix flour, egg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the butter mixture creating a cookie dough. Roll dough into teaspoon-size balls.
